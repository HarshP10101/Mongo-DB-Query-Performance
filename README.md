# Mongo-Database-
o	Developed a Python application to create two MongoDB databases, one with normalized documents and the other with embedded documents, using PyMongo library.
o	Imported data from JSON files into the MongoDB databases, creating collections for ‘songwriters’ and ‘recordings’.
o	Implemented MongoDB’s Query Language (MQL) to perform complex queries on the databases.
o	Queries included finding specific songwriters, calculating average rhythmicality, summing lengths of all recordings for each songwriter, and retrieving recording details based on issue date.
o	Ensured both databases yielded the same results for each query, demonstrating understanding of both normalized and embedded document models in MongoDB.
o	Managed the application to accept the port number as a command-line argument for flexibility and ease of use.
